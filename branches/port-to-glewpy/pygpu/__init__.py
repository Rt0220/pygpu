@mainpage PyGPU - Python for the GPU

Haven't you ever dreamt of writing code in a very high level
language and have that code execute at speeds rivaling that of
lower-level languages? PyGPU (http://www.cs.lth.se/~calle/pygpu) is
a compiler that lets you write image processing programs in Python
that execute on the graphics processing
unit (%GPU) present in modern graphics cards. This enables image
processing algorithms to take advantage of the performance of the
%GPU. In some applications, performance increases approach an order of
magnitude, compared to CPUs. 

Existing methods for programming the %GPU uses either specialised
languages (such as Cg, HLSL, or GLSL) or an embedded language in C++
(Sh) or C# (Accelerator). The specialised languages are generally very
low-level (on the level of C with some simple C++
constructs). Furthermore, they require intimate knowledge
of advanced graphics programming concepts, as well as quite
a bit of glue-code to handle parameter passing and render
pipeline setup. 

The embedded approaches admit a higher level of abstraction (being
embedded in somewhat higher level languages) and also does away with
a lot of the glue code necessary with using specialised
languages. However, neither C++ or C# come close to the simple,
direct flexibility and expressive power of more dynamic languages
such as Python or Ruby. 

PyGPU is an embedded language in Python, that allow most of Python
features (list-comprehensions, higher-order functions, iterators) to
be used for constructing %GPU algorithms. It uses a image abstraction
to abstract away implementation details of the %GPU, while still
allowing translation to very efficient %GPU native-code.
